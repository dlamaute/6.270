\chapter{Expansion Board Assembly}
\label{expboard}

While the main board comes fully assembled, you will have to assemble
the newer expansion board yourself.  If you are not familiar with soldering,
please attend the soldering workshop to learn the basics, and if you
have any further questions, no matter how small, please contact a
member of the staff before you proceed.  We'll be much happier if you
come to us before you've made a mistake than afterward.  That said,
building the expansion board should not be much of a challenge for
anyone, and we recommend that you get started on it as soon as
possible, and not fall behind.  The circuit board may look
complicated, but do not despair!  Many of its parts (such as circuitry
to make it compatible with LEGO Mindstorms sensors) are optional and
not needed for 6.270.  For reference, a complete, assembled Handy
Board is pictured at
